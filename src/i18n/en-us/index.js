  FAQ1Answer: "The Paytaca LIFT token (Leveraging Incentives for Financial Transformation) embodies the spirit of Bayanihan, a Filipino concept of community-driven voluntary cooperation. Just as communities once physically lifted houses together, LIFT symbolizes collective effort to advance Bitcoin Cash (BCH) adoption. Each token represents an individual's contribution toward moving BCH upward and forward, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. LIFT offers participants access to ecosystem benefits such as exclusive app features, reduced fees, and a voice in shaping the ecosystem.",
  FAQ1Question: "What is the LIFT Token?",
  FAQ2Answer: "To participate in the token sale, you can purchase LIFT tokens directly through the Buy tab in this app.",
  FAQ2Question: "How can I participate in the token sale?",
  FAQ3Answer: "LIFT token holders gain access to exclusive app features, reduced fees on platform services, and the ability to participate in ecosystem governance. The token is designed to incentivize active participation in the Paytaca ecosystem and contribute to the growth of Bitcoin Cash adoption.",
  FAQ3Question: "What are the benefits of holding LIFT tokens?",
  FAQ4Answer: "The vesting schedule varies by round. Early Supporter round participants have a 2-year lockup followed by quarterly releases. Strategic Partner round participants have a 1-year lockup followed by quarterly releases.",
  FAQ4Question: "What is the vesting schedule?",
  FAQ5Answer: "The total supply of 1 billion LIFT tokens is distributed across various categories: 20% for token sale, 5% for liquidity pool, 30% for community incentives, 20% for ecosystem growth, 15% for team and advisors, and 10% for reserve fund. This distribution supports long-term ecosystem development and community engagement.",
